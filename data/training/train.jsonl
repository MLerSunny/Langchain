{"prompt": "What is RAG in the context of AI?", "completion": "RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) is a technique that enhances large language models by retrieving relevant information from external knowledge sources before generating a response. This allows the model to access up-to-date information beyond its training data and provide more accurate, factual answers."}
{"prompt": "How does fine-tuning work?", "completion": "Fine-tuning is a process where a pre-trained language model is further trained on a specific dataset to adapt it to particular tasks or domains. It involves adjusting the model's parameters using a smaller learning rate to preserve general knowledge while optimizing for specific use cases. Methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) make this process more efficient by only training a small number of parameters."}
{"prompt": "What are the benefits of using vLLM?", "completion": "vLLM is a library for efficient LLM inference that offers several benefits: 1) Faster inference through PagedAttention, which optimizes memory usage, 2) Higher throughput by better batching requests, 3) Reduced memory footprint allowing larger models to run on consumer hardware, 4) OpenAI-compatible API that makes it easy to integrate with existing applications, and 5) Support for various quantization methods to further improve performance."}
