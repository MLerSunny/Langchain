{"prompt": "What is ChromaDB used for?", "completion": "ChromaDB is a vector database used for storing and retrieving embeddings efficiently. It enables semantic search in RAG applications by finding the most similar vectors to a query, allowing developers to build systems that can retrieve context-relevant information based on meaning rather than exact keyword matches."}
{"prompt": "Explain the difference between LoRA and QLoRA.", "completion": "LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method that adds small trainable matrices to the model while keeping the original weights frozen. QLoRA builds on this by first quantizing the base model to 4-bit precision to reduce memory usage, then applying LoRA. QLoRA enables fine-tuning of much larger models on consumer hardware by significantly reducing the memory footprint while maintaining performance."}
